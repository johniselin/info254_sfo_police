# info254_sfo_police

## Introduction

This github repository is for the final project for UC Berkeley's INFO 254 Course.

Our goal is to predict the prop. of reported crime in San Fransisco, and to analyse the results to determine potential sources and effects of bias in the results. 

## Data

Our data are from https://datasf.org/opendata/

We combine data from the following datasets:

* Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018 -
    * https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry
* Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present
    * https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783
* Police Department Calls for Service
    * https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Calls-for-Service/hz9m-tj6z

## Notes

* The CSV form of the data are too large to have on github, we will need to set up a system using the Data SF API.
